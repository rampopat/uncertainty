Repository Contents:

This repository contains four Colab Notebooks. I suggest that you press the ''Open in Colab'' link at the top when you open a file. We used Colab notebooks for ease of GPU access. The four notebooks are as follows, where there is a description inside each notebook with a table of contents in a markdown hierarchy.

1. Main_Notebook_DementiaBank.ipynb - This contains the code for the Bayesian Deep Learning and Referral Learning models and Active Learning implementation for the DementiaBank dataset. This includes the data and machine learning pipelines.
2. Main_Notebook_MIMIC.ipynb - Same as 1 but for the MIMIC dataset.
3. Uncertainty_Analysis.ipynb - This contains the code for the Referral Learning strategies and different uncertainty-based plots and tables in the thesis.
4. Performance_Analysis.ipynb - This contains the code for producing the performance plots and tables in the thesis.
